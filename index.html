      <h1>My name is Pethum Weerasekara</h1>
      <p>I am following the "Cyber Security" program at Wake Tech College. 
         I'm learning about coding in this course, and it seems to be an exciting subject.
         My hobbies are playing video games and cooking in my free time. Additionally, I'm investing in stock markets and a good technical analyzer.</p>
